excerpt: "Notes on a course of salesmanship for start ups that I'm doing"

## Introduction
I'm doing [this course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-black-arts-of-persuasion-for-startups/) in Udemy because sales is the area I'm the most green about and as a single-man company, even though I hate it, I need to **learn to love it**

He says it is all essential skills so we see, I would have honestly not bought this course if I knew beforehand it was only 3 hours. 

#### What is "Salesmanship" 

He defines it as "getting others to want to do what you want them to do". In my context: hire me.
