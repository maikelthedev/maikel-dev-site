excerpt: "Notes on a course of salesmanship for start ups that I'm doing"

## Introduction
I'm doing [this course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-black-arts-of-persuasion-for-startups/) in Udemy because sales is the area I'm the most green about and as a single-man company, even though I hate it, I need to **learn to love it**

He says it is all essential skills so we see, I would have honestly not bought this course if I knew beforehand it was only 3 hours. 

I'm not completely green on salesmanship, I worked for Rentalcars in Manchester for a bit and continously was getting bonuses due to performance, leasing cars. So I must know a thing or two. 

There's one big difference though, I didn't care whether I sold or not anything on Rentalcrs, I would still be paid my base salary which was quite decent. I did care about selling only because it made the job become a pastime. There was no stress. I wasn't pressured. 

But THIS, selling me, that's pressure. There's plenty of it. There's no base salary I get while in-between jobs. This is why I want 5 clients. 

#### What is "Salesmanship" 

He defines it as "getting others to want to do what you want them to do". In my context: hire me.

## Features & Benefits. 
#### Nobody wants your product

Forget about the product or service, you need to sell what the ultimate goal is. For a drilling machine, you want the hole. 

#### The art of "which means" or "so what?"

Sell benefits, not features. 

Exercise: write 5 benefits of your product or service. I think I already did this on the homepage with the section "Reasons" I might revisit it later. 

feature "WHICH MEANS" benefit

Try that exercise, for each feature find an exercise. You should put this on your website. On the reasons, be more specific. 

List every feature, then "which means". 

They need to become second nature, always think "which means". 

Memorise your services benefits, you'll need them, don't make them bullshit. 

#### Anatomy of a sales call

Well, first I need to get one of those.

Find first the prospect unique needs before selling the benefits. Find the "hot buttons". Identify them and target them as they are high impact. 

I mean this is pretty basic but you can easily create a workflow of this whole course, so i'm glad I bought it. Process creates perfection.

![Process is everything](/posts/process.webp)

It says something about a 2:1 ratio listening vs talking, listening doubel to what you talk but...I thinkt that's pretty basic. If anything I can write it down as part of a checklist. 

#### Questioning techniques

Nothing new, use open questions instead of yes/no, you already know this from the time you worked in Rentalcars

You don't need a definition of what is an open question. This is basically teh same as the art of mantaining a conversation with a complete stranger on Tinder. 

The advantage of open questions is to get opinions and feelings about whatever subject and recognize the extent of whatever problem you want to solve. 

> Are you happy with your current supplier?

Interesting bit is that another way to do this is to tell them something that makes THEM ask YOU open questions. Something intriguing to keep their attention so you can gather their feelings about it. 

Simple open questions start with:
* Why?
* How?
* What?

You can even make this part of your website form but I wouldn't recommend it as that puts friction. 

## Objection Handling

An objection is a buying signal because if people raise them they are still talking ot you, so there is interest. It's a "please convince me" signal. 

Reasons for objections:

* Just want info
* It's expected from them. 
* Price Resistance. This won't ever happen to my area. But budget constrains exists.
* Peer Justification (FOMO/JOMO)
* Delaying tactic. They want to think it through or think you're too fast. 
* Fear or Laziness. Making decisions is costly. 

#### Time and objections

They are like FAQs, with time you learn they are always the same ones and know how to respond to them instantly as you've done it before. 

Do not celebrate or be overconfident because you answered it before, pretend you didn't, be humble and acknowledge the question as being reasonable. <--This is probably where I fail mostly

#### Real vs fake objections

Sometimes they are smokescreen tactits to delay answering. Ask "suppose you completely satisfy X would you be satisfied". Probably with not those words. 

This helps you figure also what is the real objection, sometimes people don't even know themselves. 

Process:
1. Listen
2. question
3. agree
4. answer
5. check back. 

How to deal with "that's expensive" ones:
1. People might not be aware of the cost. 
2. People might not be aware of their budget. Ask them about their budget. Split a project in two...
3. Competitor. Figure the solutions the competitors give and see how you are adding value compare to those (benefits)

Techniques:
* Keep the questions relaxed
* Write down the objections. A simple CRM could help with this in the future.

Once you ahve them written group them into tops and rephras them into positive requirements....not sure what he means with the later. 

Reasons to do this:
* Clarifies concerns
* Looks for underlying emotions
* Restates them in better light. 
* Maintains empathy
* Seeks agreement. 

Not sure how much of those 5 points is bullshit because of it being common sense.
