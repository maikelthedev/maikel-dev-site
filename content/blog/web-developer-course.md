## Notes

Only growing through referrals, interesting. 

Basically he says you need to outsource some part of the programming if you want to find clients because otherwise you won't have time to find those clients. 

## Section 3: Planning an strategy
Value proposition: What exactly is that you're delivering to your customer
e.g.: taxi app --> Can get you to whatever location faster. 

YOu can be good, cheap or fast. 2 of the 3, but not the three. Think which ones you want to focus. 

DO things that do not scale? e.g.: if Facebook ad, do a tiny investment instead of big, you don't know yet if it works. 

This section was pretty much useless and taught me nothing

## Section 4: Setting up your presence. 

Clients judge you based on your website (sure, common sense)

Start simple and improve later because you don't know what works yet (on your website). 

Use templates. [Use this](https://www.templatemonster.com/) to find the templates. Finally something useful. Check them and get ideas for your site. 
Also [ThemeForset](https://themeforest.net/)

JUst google TAilwind templates

[This one](https://en.99designs.es/) for quick and cheap changes

#### Selecting a name

Use al literal name of what you do then compress it. 
PIck a feeling you wan tto convey. e.g.: TrustCoding

Compare with Benjamin's [Tech City Labs](https://www.techcitylabs.com/)

## Section 5: Finding freelancers

The thought that he wastes 1h42 minutes to enumerate three sites....Jesuschrist. 

Elance, Upwork and Freelancer. It's very dated because Elance and Upwork are now the same. 

## Section 6: Building a portfolio

I can't find anything here that is any useful to me. 

Between 5 to 10 items. 

If you ever want to grow your portfolio doing free projects use [CatchAFire](https://www.catchafire.org/)

## Section 7: Getting clients

This is the core reason I bought this course. 

Who is your ideal client base?

Email scrape is pointless due to GDPR. 

Offer adjacent services to those tryign to hire in-house: That means someone who wants to have you as employee, offer them to do it as service. For example find full-stack jobs in Linkedin and instead contact each company offering the service. This isn't a bad idea. Use ChatGPT to write down the email, Foundation to give it a nice format. If you can find the CEO and their socials. 

Email permutator is a tool that can help you find the email addresses.
