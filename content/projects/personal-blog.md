# My Personal Blog

I keep a personal blog independent from this page [here](https://blog.maikel.dev) for non-tech and some tech related stuff. The function of my blog is to apply the DRY (don't repeat yourself) principle to life so I use it mainly to keep tracked of  what worked with different subjects in life. 

Some days I just use it as a plain diary. 

I didn't want to be bothered with the format and it was born BEFORE I made this site so I used, as adviced by my fedi-neighbour [Sasha](https://chaosfem.tw/@sashag/) the software Publii as I was looking for a system with the next requirements:

* It must be free
* It must serve static files so that I could use Github Pages. 
* I wanted a static CMS but with a proper editor that could be as simple to use as Wordpress
* I didn't want to be concerned about any code, any friction added to this project would make me never use it. 

## My choices

After I asked the Fediverse, as mentioned above, I was recommended Publii, I tried it and I liked it so I use it. 
Publii uses handlebars for templating, which I'm familiar with. So whenever I have the spare time for it I might edit the out-of-the-box template I've been using.
