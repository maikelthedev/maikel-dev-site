# The Survation Panel Front-End

## The goal

Survation wanted to design their own panel, that's a tool to have their own panelist completing surveys instead of having to pay third-party suppliers of panelists, to save costs. The set of people completing surveys is what's called a "panel" in this context. 

## What I did

I created the [Survation Panel](https://panel.survation.com) from scratch using the latest version of Angular, reaching all the way from v.4 up to v.13 and maintaining it. I used Bitbucket to preserve **their** code and applied using Bootstrap a ready-made theme template of which they had a static design (just the homepage) by [Spinach](https://spinachbranding.com/), I used Boostrap to speed up design and the page allowed users to find the surveys. 

The result is in this image
