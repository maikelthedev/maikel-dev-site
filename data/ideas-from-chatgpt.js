const exclusivity = `As a freelancer, if you're aiming to attract five clients while maintaining an air of professionalism and creating a sense of exclusivity, you can use the following approach:

Emphasize your selective process:
"I am currently curating my client portfolio to ensure a strategic alignment with projects that truly resonate with my expertise and values."

Highlight your expertise and demand:
"With my extensive experience and in-demand skill set, I have limited availability to take on a select number of discerning clients."

Showcase your high standards:
"I am committed to delivering exceptional results and investing my undivided attention in each project. Therefore, I am meticulously evaluating potential collaborations to ensure the perfect fit."

Demonstrate your value:
"I bring a unique blend of industry knowledge, creativity, and a proven track record of delivering impactful solutions. By engaging my services, clients gain access to a sought-after professional who consistently exceeds expectations."

Create a sense of urgency:
"To secure my services, I recommend reaching out promptly as I anticipate a swift response due to the limited number of openings available."

Remember, while it's important to portray yourself as selective and exclusive, be sure not to come across as arrogant or unapproachable. Balancing professionalism with a welcoming demeanor will attract the right clients while maintaining your desired image.`
